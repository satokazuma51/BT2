## Project Title
AI Model Marketplace DApp

## Description
This project aims to create a decentralized application (DApp) that allows users to list, purchase, and rate AI models. The application utilizes a smart contract to handle the core functionality and ensures transparency and trust in transactions. The frontend provides an intuitive interface for users to interact seamlessly with the blockchain-based backend.

## Features
- **AI Model Listing**: Users can upload and list their AI models for others to explore.
- **Purchasing**: Secure blockchain-based transactions for buying AI models.
- **Rating System**: Users can rate AI models to help others make informed decisions.
- **Decentralization**: Core functionality managed by a smart contract.

## Technologies Used
- **Blockchain**: Ethereum or similar platform for deploying smart contracts.
- **Frontend**: React, with integrations for Web3.js or Ethers.js.
- **Smart Contract**: Solidity for Ethereum blockchain.
- **Storage**: IPFS or similar decentralized storage for AI model files.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- Node.js
- MetaMask or another Web3 wallet
- Truffle or Hardhat for smart contract deployment

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/ai-model-marketplace.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash

   npm install
   ```
3. Deploy the smart contract:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat deploy
   ```
4. Start the frontend:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Usage
1. Connect your Web3 wallet to the application.
2. Explore available AI models in the marketplace.
3. List a new AI model by providing details and uploading files.
4. Purchase a model securely through the blockchain.
5. Rate models you have purchased to help the community.
